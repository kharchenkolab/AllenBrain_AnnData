Our goal is to create a high-quality atlas of cell types in the mouse brain using large scale single cell transcriptomic analysis across the entire mouse brain. Fine dissections of brain regions and layers were performed from both hemispheres of male and female mice. Nuclei were extracted from dissected tissues, and fluorescence activated sorting of nuclei was performed based on antibody labeling of NeuN protein to sort individual nuclei into separate wells. Isolated nuclei were processed for single nuclei RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and moderate gene detection per nucleus with accurate recovery of cell type proportions within (but not between) each tissue sample. This dataset surveys cells in the primary motor cortex (MOp) as well as regions where isolation of whole cells is difficult, or nuclear profiling is needed to establish cell type proportions.
