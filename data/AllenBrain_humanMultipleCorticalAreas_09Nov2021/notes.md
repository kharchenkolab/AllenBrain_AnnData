This data set includes single-nucleus transcriptomes from 49,495 nuclei across multiple human cortical areas. Individual layers of cortex were dissected from tissues covering the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; also known as the ventral division of medial prefrontal cortex, A24), primary visual cortex (V1C), primary motor cortex (M1C), primary somatosensory cortex (S1C) and primary auditory cortex (A1C) derived from human brain. Nuclei were dissociated and sorted using the neuronal marker NeuN. Nuclei were sampled from post-mortem and neurosurgical (MTG only) donor brains and expression was profiled with SMART-Seq v4 RNA-sequencing.
